Zero-width character detection and removal for Go. Inspired by [this Medium article](https://medium.com/@umpox/be-careful-what-you-copy-invisibly-inserting-usernames-into-text-with-zero-width-characters-18b4e6f17b66).

## Installation
`go get github.com/trubitsyn/go-zero-width`

## Usage
<pre>
package main

import (
	"github.com/trubitsyn/go-zero-width"
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	login := "abcâ€‹def"					// zero-width space between "c" and "d"
	clean := zerowidth.RemoveZeroWidthCharacters(login)	// a  b  c           d  e  f
	fmt.Printf("% x\n", login)				// 61 62 63 <b>e2 80 8b</b> 64 65 66
	fmt.Printf("% x\n", clean)				// 61 62 63          64 65 66
}
</pre>

## Supported characters
* Zero-width space (U+200B)
* Zero-width no-break space (U+FEFF)
* Zero-width joiner (U+200D)
* Zero-width non-joiner (U+200C)
